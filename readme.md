# Lambda C Data Structures

Data structures implemented in C

## About Lambda C Data Structures (ldaCds)

I made this library in order to use it on future C app development.

You are free to collab with me sending more data structures, documentation or any content that could help.

All the functions and types start with the "ldaCds_" prefix, all the macros made by #define start with the "LDACDS_" prefix.
